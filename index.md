## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (also termed as EDA) is a very important step in the process of data science. It is performed at the start of the data analysis. It is a process of identifying general patterns in the data. EDA helps to indetify unexpected feature values such as null, out of range and outliers.

EDA helps to understand the data and relation between various feature values in it. EDA can tell us a lot more about the data which is not visible otherwise. Outcome of EDA helps businesses to  make impactful decisions even before the detailed analysis of data.
